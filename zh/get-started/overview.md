# Overview

#### Overview

Getting started with Console Connect is simple. Once you have [signed up](https://app.consoleconnect.com/sign-up/) you will receive an email to verify your email address.

Next, set up a password and complete a couple of details about you and then onto joining or registering your company in Console Connect.

If you register your company on Console Connect, you will be the Account Administrator. Your company will need to be [verified](https://www.consoleconnect.com/help/get-started/#company-verification) before you can order services.

If you join a company that is already registered on Console Connect, contact your Account Administrator for them to assign your appropriate [roles and permissions](https://www.consoleconnect.com/help/account-management/#roles-permissions).

Once you click on the **Complete sign up** button in the verification email, we just need your full name and job title to complete setting up your account.

Optionally, if you have a profile picture on hand now is a great time to add it.

You can update your personal details and profile information any time from the Settings menu.

Whilst your company is being verified we recommend setting up your first team member or members! If you don’t have anyone else right now, you can do this at a later time.

#### Access: get ready to connect <a href="#ready-to-connect" id="ready-to-connect"></a>

To access Console Connect connectivity services, you need to be in a Console Connect enabled data center. There are over 500 in more than 50 countries!

Order a Console Connect port in your data center. You’ll need to arrange a cross-connect with your data center (we’ll provide the LOA).

As soon as your Port is active, you can start ordering connectivity services.

**Ports**

Ordering a port is simple however there is one there is one important step we require. **You will need to arrange a cross-connect** with your data center including providing the Letter of Authorisation (LOA). What this means is you will need to send the LOA to the specified data center.

As soon as your Port is active, you can start ordering services.
